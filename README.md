## Overview

**Database-Schema-Normalization** is an innovative developer tool designed to simplify and visualize the complex process of database schema normalization. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite, it offers an interactive environment for designing schemas, analyzing functional dependencies, and ensuring data integrity through normalization standards.

**Why Database-Schema-Normalization?**

This project empowers developers to efficiently build, analyze, and normalize database schemas with ease. The core features include:

* 🌱 **Schema Builder:** Create and modify database tables interactively, supporting dynamic schema design.
* 🔍 **Dependency Analysis:** Visualize and manage functional dependencies to understand attribute relationships.
* 🗝️ **Candidate Key Finder:** Identify minimal superkeys to ensure schema uniqueness and integrity.
* 🔄 **Normalization Logic:** Validate and decompose schemas into higher normal forms like BCNF.
* 🧩 **Modular Architecture:** Leverage React contexts for centralized state management, enabling scalable and maintainable development.
* 💻 **Modern UI Integration:** Seamless setup with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for a responsive, developer-friendly experience.
